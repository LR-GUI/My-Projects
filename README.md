# My Projects

This is a repository where I upload some projects I play with about Math / Arts / Work / Data Science / M.L (unfortunately, many of the newer and richer stuff is enclosed behind academic or clinical protection).

For my art and game design, also check out:

[Instagram](http://instagram.com/lr.gui) - Finished my bear tarot deck

[Itch.io](http://lrgui.itch.io) - Finished my first complete game F.U.G.A.

Check out other repositories for other specific projects or larger projects.
