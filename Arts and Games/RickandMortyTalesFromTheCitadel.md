# MtG DD: Rick and Morty, Tales from the Citadel

This is a magic the gathering duel-decks with a theme of rick and morty. They are singleton 40-card decks.
The decks represent the story of the episode S03E07 of the series, Tales from the Citadel.
The RW deck represents the oppressed ricks and mortys and the UB deck represents the powerful ricks and mortys of the citadel.
The cards may seem overpowered, but their power level is based on an eternal cube environment and the cards were designed to play standalone.
The decks were playtested, they are balanced as they were intended and funny to play with.

This game taps into a different concept of mtg functionality as a game, a more boardgame-like view. The duel decks are a card game that uses a mtg match as the core engine. But upon the match there is the experience of playing those roles. The role of the powerful is of controlling, destroying, manipulating others, while being constantly concerned about the maintenance of their power. The oppressed role is of anger, violence, revolt that figths against a system of control, and everything is harder for them, but sometimes the revolution takes place. Some legendary cards have a higher powerlevel, making their occasional appearance an extra challenge generated on the board. And it holds all the good qualities of an eternal cube mtg match, of being a complex strategic game,  of rewarding skill, and of high replayability.

For me, this rick and morty episode is one of the greatest contents in animated media I've ever seen.
