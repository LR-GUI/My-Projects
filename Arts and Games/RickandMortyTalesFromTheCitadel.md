# MtG DD: Rick and Morty, Tales from the Citadel

This is a magic the gathering duel-decks with a theme of rick and morty. They are singleton 40-card decks.
The decks represent the story of the episode S03E07 of the series, Tales from the Citadel.
The RW deck represents the oppressed ricks and mortys and the UB deck represents the powerful ricks and mortys of the citadel.
The cards may seem overpowered, but their power level is based on an eternal cube environment and the cards were designed to play standalone.
The decks were playtested, they are balanced and funny to play with.

For me, this rick and morty episode is one of the greatest contents in animated media I've ever seen.
