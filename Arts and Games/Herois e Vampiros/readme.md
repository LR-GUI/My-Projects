[Herois e Vampiros](https://www.mobygames.com/game/heris-e-vampiros_) is an online game I played when I was 10~11 years old that is no longer available for play.
This is a remastered version I made using the original images of the cards. The sheet, ready for print, has the quantity of
cards based on a rarity scheme I proposed.

Rules:
Each player takes a vampire (black) or hero (white) deck and shuffles the cards.
Start the game with 5 cards in hand and 20 lifepoints.
At the beginning of your turn, draw a card.
Then, you may play an attack. If you do, the opponent may play a defense. Then you may play a magic card.
The game is in portuguese.
